Bulgaria Freelance Taxes Charts
===============================

For the past few years I've been living in Bulgaria, working as a software
engineer (technically, "consultant") for foreign companies (both European and
US), and by now I have a pretty good idea about all the taxes and other
business-related expenses one has to pay in this setup. Since it's ridiculously
hard to find a complete and accurate info like that, I just decided to put this
together.

This repo only contains a script to generate the charts, as well as the
resulting charts.

## Building

You'll need `make`, `python3`, as well as matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`). Having all that:

```
$ make clean all
```
